#  Rutu's Food Hub

Welcome to Rutus Food hub! This is a web application that allows users
 to create and manage their own food menu.Thus, a spot on the World Wide Web i.e.
  restaurant websites are the most essential thing. Restaurant websites can help 
  by sharing a lot more information with customers than they would get to know from 
  other sources. They help in finding maps, offers and discounts as well as special days.

Guest Experience: Use a theme that is easy to navigate, includes bold call-to-action buttons for ordering and booking, and has plenty of space for large imagery to feature your dishes. Try and find a theme that includes a dedicated section for customer reviews.
